# Overview of data
```{r}

```
> Findings:
1. Games limited to PC, Mac, and Linux
2. Nearly 34,000 different developers!
3. Data mostly complete aside from ratings - it would be good to see if this means that it is biased in any way

# cleaning data
```{r}
steamDataClean <- steamData %>% 
  select(-store_url, -store_promo_url, -...1, -image, -voiceovers, -achievements, -gfq_url, -gfq_difficulty_comment, -gfq_rating_comment, -gfq_length_comment, -stsp_owners, -stsp_mdntime, -hltb_url, -hltb_single, -hltb_complete, -meta_url, -igdb_url, -igdb_single, -igdb_complete, -published_meta, -published_hltb, -published_stsp, -published_igdb) %>% 
  mutate(
    full_price = full_price/100,
    discount = discount/100,
    current_price = current_price/100
    ) %>% 
  filter(full_price <= 200) # Only 2 games with full_price > 199.99
```

# Data Exploration
```{r}
# Density plot of prices
steamDataClean %>% 
ggplot() +
  geom_density(aes(x = full_price)) +
  theme_classic()

# Code for getting developer size
steamDataDevelopers <- steamDataClean %>% 
  group_by(developers) %>% 
  mutate(developer_size = n())

# This may not be a good measure for how well-reasourced a developer is - maybe sales data exists somewhere?
steamDataDevelopers %>% 
  group_by(developers) %>% 
  summarize(developer_size = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(developer_size))

ggplot(steamDataDevelopers) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = developer_size))

ggplot(steamDataDevelopers) +
  geom_point(aes(x = developer_size, y = full_price))
  
```
